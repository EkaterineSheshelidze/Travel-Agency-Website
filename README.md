# Travel-Agency-Website
This is a responsive front-end Travel Agency website created from scratch in 2020 for my personal practice. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site features a clean, modern UI with a custom design, responsive layouts, and interactive elements. The project showcases my skills in front-end web development and UI/UX design. To view the website, simply clone the repository, navigate to the project folder, and open the index.html file in your browser.
